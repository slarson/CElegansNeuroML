# Python script for straightening NeuroML2 worm data (positions) assuming that
# (i) the worm is already straight along the x axis, and (ii) Bezier spline
# control points that correspond to the virtual "spine" of the worm.
#
# Usage: PositionStraighten.py NMLFILE SPINETSVFILE
#
# The spine spline is the output of of blenderExportSpine.py script run
# on the VirtualWorm Blender model that includes a spine curve. The best
# known spline is also stored in the dataSets/spine-spline.tsv file nearby.
#
# Algorithm: The spine curve is converted to a densely segmented line;
# then, for each position, the nearest point on this line is found,
# distance on the line (from its beginning) is used as the y coordinate,
# distance of the vertex from the line is used as the z coordinate.

# to match the ratio scale of NeuroML coordinates.
